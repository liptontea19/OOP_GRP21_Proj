## Read this before you do anything to the files pls

## Data Files
Use relative pathing in your code to navigate to them ("data\[file_name.csv]")

Windows Users (VS Code): 'data\[file_name.csv]' or 'data\\[file_name.csv]' Use backslash "\" or double backslash "\\"

Mac Users: 'data/[file_name.csv]' use normal slash "/"
## Class Files
class files are stored in the src/[package name]/ areas respectively. If a file interfaces mainly through accounts.class, put them in the accounts package. Same for bank.


## Use this command to generate javadocs for the two packages from your terminal
javadoc -d doc src\account\* src\bank\* 
(if there are more packages add them as additional arguments to the terminal input in the format src\[package name]\*)
